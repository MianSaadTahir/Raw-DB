# Raw DB
A lightweight, modular, and extensible **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** built from scratch in C++. It supports SQL-like operations, B+ tree indexing, transaction control, role-based authentication, and a simple console interface. It demonstrates core principles of modern DBMS design.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin & Guest login with secure credentials.
- **SQL-like Command Support**: Create tables, insert data, SELECT queries, JOINs.
- **Page-Based Storage Engine**: Efficient persistent data storage using pages.
- **B+ Tree Indexing**: Fast access through indexed keys.
- **Transaction Control**: Basic locking via a `LockManager` for consistency.
- **Recovery System**: Backup and restore databases.
- **Parser + Executor**: Converts and runs commands through a structured interface.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into clearly defined components for extensibility.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for major modules like FileManager, StorageEngine, Transactions, Recovery, etc.


## Architecture
The system is divided into two major parts:
### 1. **User-Facing Components**
- `main.cpp`: Command-line interface for interacting with the DB.
- `AccessControl`: Handles login and role verification.
- `Parser`: Parses user commands into structured data.
- `Executor`: Maps parsed commands to database operations.

### 2. **Backend Components**
- `Database`: Manages schema, tables, and data.
- `StorageEngine`: Handles page I/O, buffer pool, and indexing.
- `TransactionManager` & `LockManager`: Ensures data consistency.
- `RecoveryManager`: Backs up and restores the database.
