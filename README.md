# Raw DB
A lightweight, modular, and extensible **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** built from scratch in C++. It supports SQL-like operations, B+ tree indexing, transaction control, role-based authentication, and a simple console interface. It demonstrates core principles of modern DBMS design.

## Features
- Admin & Guest login with secure credentials
- Create tables, insert data, SELECT queries, JOINs
- Efficient persistent data storage using pages
- Fast access through indexed keys
- Locking via a LockManager for consistency
- Backup and restore databases
- Converts and runs commands through a structured interface for parsing

## Architecture
The system is divided into two major parts:
### 1. **User-Facing Components**
- `main.cpp`: Command-line interface for interacting with the DB
- `AccessControl`: Handles login and role verification
- `Parser`: Parses user commands into structured data
- `Executor`: Maps parsed commands to database operations

### 2. **Backend Components**
- `Database`: Manages schema, tables, and data
- `StorageEngine`: Handles page I/O, buffer pool, and indexing
- `TransactionManager` & `LockManager`: Ensures data consistency
- `RecoveryManager`: Backs up and restores the database
